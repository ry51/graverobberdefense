## General Changes
* Tombs are now upgradable, from Pits in the Sand all the way to the Valley of the Kings
* Enemies scale faster past wave 30 to compensate for the increased strength of the player's tomb

## UI/QOL
* Numbers now always display with the minimum number of significant digits necessary to reduce clutter
